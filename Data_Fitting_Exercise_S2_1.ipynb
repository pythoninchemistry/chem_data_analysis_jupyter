    "A common part of data analysis is **fitting** a mathematical model to some experimental data. This might be to determine how well a particular model describes your experimental data, or to extract a numerical parameter; for example, fitting rate laws to reactant concentrations over time to obtain rate constants. Another example is the semester 1 exercise, where you fitted CO$_2$ vapour pressures to the Clausius-Clapeyron equation to obtain phase transition enthalpies.\n",
    "\n",
    "A third example where fitting to simple exerimental data can give chemical information about a particular reaction involves the **Van't Hoff equation**. This relates the change in the equilibrium constant, $K$, for a reaction, to a change in temperature, providing the enthalpy change for the reaction, $\\Delta H$, is constant:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\,\\ln{K}}{\\mathrm{d}\\,T} = \\frac{\\Delta H}{RT^2}.\\tag{1}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "The derivation of this equation comes from combining two standard equations for the Gibbs free energy change, $\\Delta G$, for a reaction:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\Delta G = \\Delta H - T \\Delta S\\tag{2}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\Delta G = -RT \\ln{K}\\tag{3}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "Combining these two equations, we get\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\ln{K} = -\\frac{\\Delta H}{RT} + \\frac{\\Delta S}{R}.\\tag{4}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the **linear** form of the Van't Hoff equation. Differentiating with respect to $\\frac{1}{T}$ (keeping $\\Delta H$ and $\\Delta S$ constant) gives equation 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the linear form of the Van't Hoff equation gives the equation for a straight line (hence &ldquo;linear&rdquo;) a plot of $\\ln{K}$ against $\\frac{1}{T}$ should give a straight line, as long as the enthalpy and entropy of reaction are approximately constant over the temperature range of interest. Furthermore, a straight line fitted to these data will have a slope of $-\\frac{\\Delta H}{R}$ and an intercept of $\\frac{\\Delta S}{R}$. By performing a linear fit, it is therefore possible to extract values for $\\Delta H$ and $\\Delta S$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the semeseter 1 lab, you learned how to use the `linregress()` function (from `scipy.stats`) to perform a linear regression (fit a straight line to a set of data). This exercises will work through model fitting in a bit more detail, divided into three parts. \n",
    "1. In the first part, you will have the opportunity to revise and practice working with data, and using `scipy.stats.linregress` to fit a straight line, to obtain the experimental reaction enthalpy and entropy for an equilibrium. \n",
    "2. The second part will go into more detail about what we mean when we talk about &ldquo;fitting&rqduo; a straight line, and will show you a different, more general, approach to solving the same problem, that involves writing your own functions. \n",
    "3. In the third part, you will apply what you have learned to fit a **non-linear** model to some experimental data, to analyse a flash-photolysis experiment.\n",
