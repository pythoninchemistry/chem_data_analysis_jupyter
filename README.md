# Data Analysis with Jupyter Notebooks

This is a short introduction to Jupyter notebooks and the Python programming language for data analysis.
This course was designed as a first introduction to programming for first year chemistry students at the [University of Bath](http://www.bath.ac.uk/departments/department-of-chemistry/).
However, the skills introduced are relatively general for numerical data analysis and plotting.

The course was developed by [Dr Benjamin Morgan](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3056-8233) with input from [Dr Fiona Dickinson](https://researchportal.bath.ac.uk/en/persons/fiona-dickinson/).
Since its introduction in 2016, this course has been ably demonstrated by:
