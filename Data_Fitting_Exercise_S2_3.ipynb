    "\n",
    "Flash photolysis is a technique for investigating fast photochemical reactions, by exposing the reactant to very brief and intense flashes of light, and then spectroscopically analysing the resulting products. The data collected give a measure of fluorescence intensity with respect to time. The time scale is usually of the order of picoseconds, while the measure of intensity is usually the photon count. \n",

    "The pre-exponential factors $A_1$ and $A_2$ govern the contribution of each exponential decay (green and red line) to the overall signal. $t$ is the time, and $k_{1}$ and $k_{2}$ are the respective radiative rate constants for each lifetime.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a bi-exponential plot such as the one displayed in the Figure below, there are three key features. The blue curve is the flash or pump signal. It is a very brief flash from the light source and will always show up in the signal. The green curve is the exponential decay signal from a short fluorescence lifetime. The red curve is the exponential decay signal from a longer fluorescence lifetime.\n",

    "* Equation 1 only describes the fluorescence decay. It does not include a description of the initial increase in intensity. When you perform your fit, you can limit your fitting data to the decay portion by slicing from the 200th element onwards; e.g. `data[200:]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* If you do not specify any additional options for `minimize`, the optimisation algorithm can try any values for the model parameters. Because the intensity model contains terms that look like $\\mathrm{e}^{-x}$, if the algorithm tries negative numbers for $k_1$ or $k_2$ this can produce a result too large for the computer to describe, and give an error. In reality, we know that $k_1$ and $k_2$ must be positive. We can include this information in the function minimisation by including an additional setting that places **bounds** on the possible values of $P$:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "minimize( … , bounds=((0,1), (0,1), (0,np.inf), (0,np.inf)) )\n",
    "```\n",
    "The `bounds` argument takes a list of pairs of numbers, that specify the minimum and maximum allowed values to check. If $P$ is ordered as $(A_1, A_2, k_1, k_2)$, this example specifies that $A_1$ and $A_2$ must be between 0 and 1 (we know that the maximum intensity at $t=0$ is equal to 1), and that $k_1$ and $k_2$ must be between 0 and (positive) infinity.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* The `minimize()` function works by trying different parameter values until the result of the test function falls below a certain convergence tolerance. The default convergence settings for `minimize()` are not small enough to guarantee that you find the optimal set of parameter values. You can specify a lower tolerance setting by using the `tol` keyword:\n",
