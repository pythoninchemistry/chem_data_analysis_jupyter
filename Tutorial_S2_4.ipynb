    "Both of these functions have been very simple toy examples, and could be replaced with the `+` and `-` operations. So why do we want to write functions? As you write more complex code, functions are one way to keep this organised. Functions are self-contained. Any variables you create or change inside a function are separate from variable outside that function, either in your main code, or in other functions. This lets you tackle complex problems by breaking them up into a sequence of smaller steps, describing each step with a function, and then calling each function in turn. If one function is not working as it is supposed to, you know that you only need to change code inside that function, instead of having to check every line in your code. Functions also let you reuse complex bits of code multiple times without having to rewrite them, making your code easier to read and keep organised."
