    "\n",
    "# Tutorial 1\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In the CH10009 &ldquo;Data Analysis using Jupyter Notebooks&rdquo; you were introduced to simple programmatic data analysis and plotting using the Python programming language and Jupyter Notebooks. This practical builds on that previous activity. By working through these notebooks, you will \n",
    "1. Revisit the key ideas from the Part 1 practical, giving you more experience and practice writing your own code.\n",
    "2. Learn how to write your own functions, which can then be used to organise your code, and to perform more sophistocated data analyses.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Assessment\n",
    "\n",
    "The assessment of this practical has two components:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. After completing **Exercise 3**, save your final notebook (using **File > Save and Checkpoint** in the Jupyter menu), and upload this .ipynb file to Moodle. Please make sure that you have run your notebook from a fresh start, and that it works as expected, before saving and submitting (**Kernel > Restart and Run All** from the Jupyter menu).\n",
    "2. A Moodle quiz.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Review of Part 1\n",
    "\n",
    "The CH10009 Part 1 practical covered the following concepts:\n",
    "- Introduction to Jupyter notebooks\n",
    "    - Opening Jupyter notebooks\n",
    "    - Running code\n",
    "- Code versus Markdown cells\n",
    "- Importing modules\n",
    "- Mathematical functions\n",
    "- Variables\n",
    "- Numbers, Strings, and Lists\n",
    "- `numpy` and arrays\n",
    "- Plotting data with `matplotlib`\n",
    "    - line styles\n",
    "    - formatting points\n",
    "    - labelling axes and adding titles\n",
    "    - saving to a PDF\n",
    "- Introduction to data analysis and statistics, using `numpy`:\n",
    "    - Some useful `numpy` functions: `min()`, `max()`, `sum()`, `mean()`, `std()`\n",
    "    - linear regression, using `scipy.stats.linregress`\n",
    "    \n",
    "In this practical you will quickly review these concepts, before building on these to develop your programming and data analysis skills. This review of the Part 1 material will be fairly compact, so if there are any parts you are unsure about, remember that you can always review your Part 1 Tutorial notebooks. These will either still be on your `H:` drive, or you can download them from the [CH10009 Moodle page](https://moodle.bath.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=538). You can also insert new code cells to run any bits of code you like, to check that you understand how the examples work. Code cells can be inserted into any notebook using **Insert > Insert Cell Above** or **Insert > Insert Cell Below** from the Jupyter menu. "
