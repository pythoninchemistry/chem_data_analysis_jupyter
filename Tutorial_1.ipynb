    "\n",
    "This is a Jupyter notebook. In some ways each document is like a physical notebook. It can be used for describing an experiment, recording data, and commenting on it. Unlike a physical notebook, a Jupyter notebook also allows you to run and easily share computer code. This combination makes Jupyter notebooks a very useful tool for analysing data collected from experiments. Unlike spreadsheets or combinations of separate data analysis codes, a Jupyter notebook allows you to collect desciptions and notes for individual experiments, links to the raw data collected, the computer code that performs any necessary data analysis, and the final figures generated with these data, ready for use in a report or published paper.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why analyse data using code?<a id=\"id\"></a>\n",
    "Using computer code allows you to analyse experimental data *programmatically*. All the steps for working with your data are carried out according to a *program*; a predefined series of instructions; like a recipe for a particular meal. \n",
    "\n",
    "Once a particular program has been written, it will always produce the same results with the same starting data. This makes it possible to &ldquo;show your working&rdquo;. Scientists presenting new results can share their original data, alongside the code that they used for all their analysis. This has a number of benefits. Other scientists can review the code, run it against the original data set, and check that any analysis has been done correctly. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finished code can also be used as a starting point for looking at a similar set of data. The original scientist might repeat their experiment to confirm their results, or another group might collect data under slightly different conditions, and want to compare the two cases. Often the steps described by the code are the same for small data sets and for large data sets. Once an analysis program exists, processing enormous data sets simply becomes a question of access to sufficiently powerful computers. "

In these examples, we will be using Python (specifically Python 3). Python is increasingly used across a large number of scientific disciplines for data management and analysis.
